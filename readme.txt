== Description ==

Replaces the manually managed Secondary Menu with one that automatically lists the current section's subpages. You must be using the Genesis Framework and have the Secondary Menu enabled (Genesis > Theme Settings > Navigation Settings).

Simply activate the plugin, then go to a page with subpages. It should list all the subpages in the secondary menu. Navigating to a subpage will keep the same menu (it lists all subpages of top level page, not current page).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `genesis-subpages-as-secondary-menu` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the *Plugins* menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Genesis > Theme Settings > Navigation Settings and ensure "Include Secondary Navigation Menu" is checked.


== Changelog ==

**Version 1.1**

* Added 'be_genesis_subpages_args' filter so that you can modify the page arguments.

**Version 1.0**

* This is version 1.0.  Everything's new!
